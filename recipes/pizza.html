    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Rustic sourdough pizza topped with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, 
        fresh mozzarella, basil, and a drizzle of olive oil, 
        baked on a blazing-hot stone until the crust blisters and the cheese melts into creamy puddles.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
