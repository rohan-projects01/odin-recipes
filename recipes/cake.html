        <li>flour</li>
        <li>cocoa powder</li>
        <li>leaveners</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>Make cake: Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; mix for 3 minutes with an electric mixer. Stir in boiling water by hand.</li>
        <li>Pour evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While cakes cool, make frosting: Cream butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in confectioners' sugar and cocoa alternately with milk and vanilla. Beat to a smooth spreading consistency.</li>
        <li>Split the layers of the cooled cake horizontally, cover the top of each layer with frosting, then stack them onto a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Frost the outside of the cake with remaining frosting.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
